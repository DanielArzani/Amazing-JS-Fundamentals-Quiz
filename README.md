# Amazing-JS-Fundamentals-Quiz

## What is it?

A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Purpose

To help prepare those fresh coders who have just finish their studies and wish to find work in this field.
On the journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process.

## Why this is important?

Coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers. In fact, employers often use them to filter out job candidates with a cut-off score.

## How it works

The quiz will start when you click on the Start Quiz button, then the timer will start. You will have 100 seconds to answer all 10 questions and if you get a wrong answer then you will lose 10 seconds. You're final score will be what time is left over, then you can add your initials and your score will be saved. Keep in mind that only the 5 highest scores get saved and displayed.
